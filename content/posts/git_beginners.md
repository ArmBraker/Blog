## GitHub with VSCode

### Introduction

I recently decided to start making a blog about my journey to "IT Knowledge"... This decision came into my mind because ```I s*ck in making of notes``` and also my English is not in the level which I would be comfort with...

My ultimate idea is to create a blog webpage with my notes and writeups powered by [HUGO CMS](https://gohugo.io/)

One of the first blogs will be how I configured my blog environment. So, we have this post about ***Git in VS Code***

### Set up Git in VS Code

#### GIT Installation

To use Git and **GitHub in VS Code**, first make sure you have Git installed on your computer.
I installed by using Chocolatey package manager: [Choco](https://chocolatey.org/)

```powershell
choco install git -y
```

#### Sign into GIT in VS Code

You can sign into VS Code with your GitHub account in the Accounts menu in the lower right of the Activity bar to enable additional features like Settings Sync, but also cloning and publishing repositories from GitHub.

### My usage of GIT

For the moment of writing this article I am using the GIT for managing my HUGO environment and publishing static pages generated by HUGO into [***GitHub Pages***](https://pages.github.com/).

Whole process is described in hugo documentation [Host on GitHub Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github).

### Cheatsheet

#### Setup

- **Initialize a Repository**: `git init`
- **Clone a Repository**: `git clone [url]`
- **Set User Information**:
  - `git config --global user.name "[firstname lastname]"`
  - `git config --global user.email "[valid-email]"`

#### Working with Files

- **Add Files to Stage**: `git add [file]`
- **Unstage Files**: `git reset [file]`
- **Commit Changes**: `git commit -m "[descriptive message]"`
- **Show Status**: `git status`
- **Show Changes**: `git diff`
- **Show Staged Changes**: `git diff --staged`

#### Branches and Merging

- **List Branches**: `git branch`
- **Create a New Branch**: `git branch [branch-name]`
- **Switch Branches**: `git checkout [branch-name]`
- **Merge Branches**: `git merge [branch]`

#### Remote Repositories

- **Add Remote Repository**: `git remote add [alias] [url]`
- **Fetch Updates**: `git fetch [alias]`
- **Pull Changes**: `git pull [alias] [branch]`
- **Push Changes**: `git push [alias] [branch]`

#### Inspect and Compare

- **Show Commit History**: `git log`
- **Show Commit History for a File**: `git log --follow [file]`
- **Show Differences Between Branches**: `git diff branchB...branchA`
