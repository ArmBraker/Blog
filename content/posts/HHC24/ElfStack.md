## Introduction

- At the beginning there is an information table informing players that the challenge can be solved by using SIEM solution based on ELK `(Elastic, Logdash, Kibana)` stack.
- Of course I used the easier way and jump for an option with SIEM solution. But, I for some challenges I was forced to parse them manually with good-old **Linux** tools.

## Easy mode - ðŸ¥ˆ

- **Question** 1: How many unique values are there for the event_source field in all logs?
- ***Answer***: 5

- **Question** 2: Which event_source has the fewest number of events related to it?
- ***Answer***: AuthLog

- **Question** 3: Using the event_source from the previous question as a filter, what is the field name that contains the name of the system the log event originated from?
- ***Answer***: event.hostname

- **Question** 4: Which event_source has the second highest number of events related to it?
- AuthLog:269
- GreenCoat: 7496
- NetflowPmacct: 34679
- SnowGlowMailPxy: 1398
- WindowsEvent: 2299324
- ***Answer***: NetflowPmacct

- **Question** 5: Using the event_source from the previous question as a filter, what is the name of the field that defines the destination port of the Netflow logs?
- ***Answer***: event.port_dst

- **Question** 6: Which event_source is related to email traffic?
- ***Answer***: SnowGlowMailPxy

- **Question** 7: Looking at the event source from the last question, what is the name of the field that contains the actual email text?
- ***Answer***: event.Body

- **Question** 8: Using the 'GreenCoat' event_source, what is the only value in the hostname field?
- ***Answer***: SecureElfGwy

- **Question** 9: Using the 'GreenCoat' event_source, what is the name of the field that contains the site visited by a client in the network?
- ***Answer***: event.url

- **Question** 10: Using the 'GreenCoat' event_source, which unique URL and port (URL:port) did clients in the TinselStream network visit most?
- ***Answer***: pagead2.googlesyndication.com:443

- **Question** 11: Using the 'WindowsEvent' event_source, how many unique Channels is the SIEM receiving Windows event logs from?
- ***Answer***: 5

- **Question** 12: What is the name of the event.Channel (or Channel) with the second highest number of events?
- Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational: 11751
- Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational: 17713
- Security: 2268402
- Windows PowerShell: 50
- ***Answer***: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational

- **Question** 13: Our environment is using Sysmon to track many different events on Windows systems. What is the Sysmon Event ID related to loading of a driver?
- ***Answer***: 6

- **Question** 14: What is the Windows event ID that is recorded when a new service is installed on a system?
- ***Answer***: 4697

- **Question** 15: Using the WindowsEvent event_source as your initial filter, how many user accounts were created?
- ***Answer***: 0

===

## Hard mode - Gold ðŸ¥‡

- **Question** 1: What is the event.EventID number for Sysmon event logs relating to process creation?
- ***Answer***: 1

- **Question** 2: How many unique values are there for the 'event_source' field in all of the logs?
- ***Answer***: 5

- **Question** 3: What is the event_source name that contains the email logs?
- ***Answer***: SnowGlowMailPxy

- **Question** 4: The North Pole network was compromised recently through a sophisticated phishing attack sent to one of our elves. The attacker found a way to bypass the middleware that prevented phishing emails from getting to North Pole elves. As a result, one of the Received IPs will likely be different from what most email logs contain. Find the email log in question and submit the value in the event 'From:' field for this email log event.
- ***Answer***: kriskring1e@northpole.local

- **Question** 5: Our ElfSOC analysts need your help identifying the hostname of the domain computer that established a connection to the attacker after receiving the phishing email from the previous question. You can take a look at our GreenCoat proxy logs as an event source. Since it is a domain computer, we only need the hostname, not the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the system.
- ***Answer***:  SleighRider

- **Question** 6: What was the IP address of the system you found in the previous question?
- ***Answer***: 172.24.25.12

- **Question** 7: A process was launched when the user executed the program AFTER they downloaded it. What was that Process ID number (digits only please)?
- ***Answer***: 10014

- **Question** 8: Did the attacker's payload make an outbound network connection? Our ElfSOC analysts need your help identifying the destination TCP port of this connection.
- ***Answer***: 8443
